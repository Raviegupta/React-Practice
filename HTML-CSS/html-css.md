- Like block elements, `inline-block elements can have margins, padding,` and borders applied to them.
- when `inline is converted to inline-block `:- it will start to `take width & height & top, bottom padding & margin`. <br />
- useful when we want an element to have block-like features (such as margins and padding) while still flowing inline with other elements.

used to select and style elements in an HTML document.

1. Simple Selector :- Element Selector, Class Selector, ID Selector
2. Combinator Selector :- `Delhi Chennai Andhra Gujrat`
   - `Descendant selector (space)` :- all child weather own child, grand child, nested child...
   - `Child selector (>)` :- only main child.
   - `Adjacent sibling selector (+)` :- `directly` after another specific element. (first neighbour)
   - `General Sibling selector (~)` :- `all elements` that are next siblings of a specified element. (all neighbour)
3. Attribute Selector :- `[]` with the attribute name and value.

   - `a[target] {background-color: yellow;}`
   - `a[target="_blank"] {background-color: yellow;}`
   - `[title~="flower"] {border: 5px solid blue;}` :- contains `exact` in a space-separated list of words
   - `[title="flower"] {border: 5px solid blue;}` :- `starts with` `exact` value.
     - `[attribute|="top"]` :-  `starts with` `exact` value. `hypen allowed, space not`
     - `[attribute^="value"]` :- `starts with` `exact` value. `hypen, space allowed`
     - `[attribute$="value"]` :- `ends with` `exact` value. `hypen, space allowed`
     - `[attribute*="value"]` :- `contains` `exact` value. `hypen, space allowed`
     - `input[type="text"] { }`

4. Pseudo-class selectors :- `special state` of an element.
   - `a:link`, `a:visited`, `a:hover`, `a:active`
   - `:first-child` :- first child of any element.
   - `p i:first-child` :- `first <i> element in all <p> elements`:
   - `p:first-child i` :- all `<i>` elements in `<p>` elements that are the first child of any element:
   - `:last-child` :- Selects every `<p>` elements that is the last child of its parent

   - `::before` :- insert some content before the content of an element. ex:- `h1::before {content: 'Ravie'}`
   - `::after` :-
   - `::marker` :- selects the markers of list items.`::marker { color: red; font-size: 50px; }`

### Q5. Describe the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties in CSS Flexbox.

used to control how flex items grow, shrink, and are initially sized within a flex container. <br />

- `flex-grow`: how much a flex item should grow relative to the other flex items in the same container when there is extra space available. default: 0,
- `flex-shrink`: how much a flex item should shrink relative to the other flex items in the same container when there is not enough space available. default: 1,
- `flex-basis`: specifies the initial size of a flex item before any remaining space is distributed according to the flex-grow and flex-shrink properties.
- Flex is shorthand for grow, shrink, and basis when all put together. It defaults to 0 (grow) 1 (shrink) and auto (basis).

---

### Q6. Explain the use of the position property in CSS with examples. [Practical]

5 - static, relative, fixed, absolute, sticky
`static`: default value. positioned according to the normal flow of the document. positioning is not affected by the top, right, bottom, or left properties. <br />
`relative` : positioned `relative to their normal position` in the document flow. can use top, right, bottom, left properties to move the element from its normal position. <br />
`absolute` : removed from the normal document flow and positioned `relative to the nearest positioned ancestor`. <br />
`fixed` : removed from the normal document flow and positioned `relative to the viewport`. (means they remain in the same position even when the page is scrolled.) <br />
`sticky` : positioned `based on the user's scroll position`. <br /> - They behave like relative positioning until they reach a specified offset from the top of the viewport, at which point they become fixed until the user scrolls back to that point.

---

### Q7. Explain the concept of CSS specificity and how it is calculated.

CSS specificity is a `set of rules` used to determine `which CSS styles are applied to an element when multiple conflicting styles are present`.
calculated using four components:

1. Inline Styles: 1000
2. ID Selectors: 100
3. Class Selectors, Attribute Selectors, and Pseudo-classes: 10
4. Type Selectors and Pseudo-elements: 1 <br>
   calculation method <br>
   - Start with a specificity of 0.
   - For each Inline selector, add 1000 to the specificity.
   - For each ID selector, add 100 to the specificity.
   - For each class selector, attribute selector, or pseudo-class, add 10 to the specificity.
   - For each type selector or pseudo-element, add 1 to the specificity.
     ex:- `div#myId.myClass` has a specificity of 111 (1 ID selector, 1 class selector, and 1 type selector).

---

### Q8. Explain !important keyword?

!important rule is a `special case that overrides specificity`.

- When !important is added to a style, it takes `precedence over all other declarations, regardless of their specificity`.

---

### Q9. What is the difference between margin and padding?

`margin` :- `space outside an element's border`. transparent areas that separate an element from other elements in the layout.

### Q10. How do you make a text input field read-only in HTML?

To make a `text input field read-only` in HTML, add the `readonly attribute` to the `<input>` element. This attribute prevents users from editing the content of the input field, but they can still select and copy the text. <br />
`<input type="text" value="ReadOnlyText" readonly>`

- `positions` :- 
.child{ width: 100px; height: 100px; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; transform: translate(-50%, -50%); }

---

### Q2. How do pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) work in CSS?
