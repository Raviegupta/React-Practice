## Q. Why we use hooks in React ?
In React, Hooks are special functions that allow functional components to have state and side effects.
Before the introduction of hooks, state and lifecycle methods were primarily used in class components.
Hooks provide a more concise and expressive way to manage state, side effects, and other React features in functional components.

Here are some key reasons why hooks are used in React:

1. #### State Management in Functional Components:
    - The useState hook allows us to declare state variables and update them in a functional component.
2. #### Side Effects:
    - The useEffect hook enables functional components to perform side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations.
    - It replaces lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in class components.
3. #### Code Reusability:
4. #### Easy to Learn and Use:
5. #### Compatibility with Functional Programming:
