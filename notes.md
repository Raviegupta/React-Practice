Q. Why we use hooks in React ?

ans:- In React, Hooks are special functions that allow functional components to have state and side effects.
Before the introduction of hooks, state and lifecycle methods were primarily used in class components.
Hooks provide a more concise and expressive way to manage state, side effects, and other React features in functional components.
